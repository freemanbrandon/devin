### 2. Game Implementation
- **Main Game Component** (`BattleshipGame.jsx`):
  - Complete game state management using React hooks
  - Ship placement logic with validation
  - Turn-based gameplay (Player vs Computer)
  - Win/lose condition checking
  - Game reset functionality
  - **NEW: Ship rotation functionality** with dedicated rotate button

- **Game Board Component** (`GameBoard.jsx`):
  - 10×10 grid with letter/number coordinates (A-J, 1-10)
  - Visual ship display and shot tracking
  - Click handling for ship placement and firing
  - Responsive design for mobile devices
  - **UPDATED: Tailwind CSS styling** with professional look

- **Ship Selector Component** (`ShipSelector.jsx`):
